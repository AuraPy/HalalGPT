# HalalGPT

HalalGPT is an easy to use application with a GUI named HalalGUI in which you can talk to ChatGPT as if he was muslim!

## Installation

### Windows
If you have Windows, your in luck! Just download the "dist" folder from the repository and run the .exe file to open the app. Its that easy!

### Linux
If you have a GNU/Linux distribution installed on your system, you cannot install the app. Thankfully, it is quite easy to run the raw code instead. download the "raw" folder from the repository and install python 3.9 or above (3.12 recommnended). Then install pip3 and run `pip3 install openai pathlib mutagen pygame requests pyqt5`. Now all you have to do to run the app is run the `HalalGPT-linux.py` file!

### Mac OS
This app has not been tested on Mac OS, but hopefully you can use the linux instructions to run the source code!

## Requirements
To use HalalGPT, you will need an OpenAI API Key, and you will need to paste it into the settings. If you don't want to paste your API Key into the settings, you can also use the .env file and paste it into there. Note that you cannot use the .env file on linux or Mac OS. Then in the settings menu you will need to choose a voice for HalalGPT. You can also switch between light and dark mode in the settings.
